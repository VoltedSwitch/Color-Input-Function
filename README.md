# Color Input Function
This program features a reusable function that anyone can incorporate into their code. Similar to the standard input function, this function captures and returns user input. However, the unique aspect of this incolor function is that it returns the user input in a randomly selected color from a palette of beautiful and bright colors: Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Pink, Cyan, and Blue! ðŸ˜„
